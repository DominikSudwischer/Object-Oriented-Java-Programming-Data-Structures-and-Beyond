# Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond by the University of California, San Diego, offered at Coursera.

I am taking this course to learn Java coming from a background of mainly C++ and Python.

The course utilizes the UnfoldingMaps and Processing libraries to build an interactive map applet. The code in this repository will be extended over the course period.

The uploaded files are mainly the starter code provided by the instructors but will be gradually transform from bare-bones to a fully-fledged application.
